Sweet Shop Management System

This is a full-stack Sweet Shop Management System built as part of a technical assessment.
The project allows users to register, log in, view available sweets, and purchase them.
Admins can manage the sweet inventory by adding, updating, and restocking items.

The application is built using the MERN stack with proper authentication and role-based access.
